# data-driven-production-problem
This repo contains various functions related to the data-driven prediction in multiphase  reservoir flow problem. More specifically, given flow rates and pressure only, without knowing the physical parameters of the well and reservoir, we want to see how good machine/deep learning algorithms can be in predicting future events.  The scope of this project includes: - Handcrafted feature formulation for pressure and flow rate problem.    Function `buildfeature()`, `build_Ei_feature()`, and `structure_features` are used to play    around with the feature set-up. - Performance of 10 algorithms in solving pressure and flow rate time-series problem.    Function `build_pipe()` is used for this purpose; it trains the data using 10 algorithms,    performs hyperparameters search, and computes prediction scores. - How complexities (noise, heterogeneity, anisotropy, etc.) affect the result of the ML prediction (on-going)
